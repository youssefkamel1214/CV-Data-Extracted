Associate Software Engineer
Nokia

Dear Nokia Hiring Team,
I am excited to apply for the Associate Software Engineer role at Nokia, a global leader in driving technological innovation. With
a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Ain Shams University, an FWD Android Nanodegree certification, and hands-on
experience in full-stack development and agile collaboration, I am eager to contribute my technical foundation, problem-solving
skills, and passion for building scalable software solutions to Nokia’s cutting-edge projects.
During my internship at Smart Village Services W.L.L., I developed a versatile skill set by working on end-to-end software
solutions:
• Backend & API Development: Designed RESTful API documentation and database schemas for a customized HRM module,
enabling seamless integration of a check-in system that reduced manual tracking by 40%.
• Full-Stack Implementation: Built a real-time Chat App using Flutter (frontend) and Firebase (backend), incorporating MVC
architecture for scalability and maintainability.
• Process Automation: Developed features for an inventory management app that automated workflows, cutting operational
effort by 50% through Firebase real-time updates.
These projects required proficiency in Java, Kotlin, Flutter, Firebase, and SQL, along with a strong grasp of OOP, data structures,
and algorithms. My FWD Nanodegree training further honed my understanding of software engineering best practices,
including multi-threading, design patterns (MVVM), and test-driven development.
Beyond technical expertise, my completed military service instilled discipline, resilience, and teamwork—qualities that align with
Nokia’s collaborative culture. I thrive in dynamic environments, as demonstrated by my rapid adaptation to Flutter and Firebase
during my internship, and I am eager to apply this agility to contribute to Nokia’s advancements in 5G, IoT, or cloud-native
solutions.
What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to grow as a software engineer while working on projects that redefine
global connectivity. I am confident my combination of technical execution, academic rigor, and dedication to continuous learning
positions me to add value to your team from day one.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm align with
Nokia’s vision. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at 2012 2055 9085 or
youssefmk1214@gmail.com.
Sincerely, Youssef Kamel
